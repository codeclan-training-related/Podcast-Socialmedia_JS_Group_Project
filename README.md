## `npm run server:dev`
By running npm run server:dev, you can start the development server and test your application locally during the development process. It enables you to make changes to your code and see the results in real-time without the need to manually restart the server.
## Folder and File
## README.md
## "client" refers to the directory that contains the client-side code of the application. It is where the frontend code resides, responsible for the user interface and interactions with the user.
## The src folder which live in client folder is the place where developers write their code. This is where they can store all of their source files, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other files. The dist folder is where the compiled code is stored. This is the code that is ready to be deployed to a production environment.
## "server" folder typically refers to the directory that contains the server-side code of the application. It is where the backend code resides, responsible for handling requests from the client, processing data, and managing the application's business logic.# Podcast-Socialmedia_JS_Group_Project
